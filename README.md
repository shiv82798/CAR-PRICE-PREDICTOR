Car Price Predictor ðŸš—ðŸ’°
A machine learning-based app designed to predict the price of a car based on its specifications and features. This project demonstrates how data-driven models can provide accurate pricing estimates, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

Features
Input Features: Accepts key car details such as:
Make, model, and year
Mileage and engine type
Transmission type
Fuel type
Number of owners
Accurate Predictions: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to estimate car prices.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-navigate UI for inputting data and viewing results.
Customizable Model: Swap datasets or adjust parameters for different markets.
Tech Stack
Backend: Python with Flask/Django for model integration.
Machine Learning: Trained using Scikit-learn, XGBoost, or TensorFlow/Keras.
Dataset: Based on public datasets (e.g., Kaggle car price data) or custom datasets.
How It Works
Input car details into the app.
The data is processed by a pre-trained machine learning model.
The app provides an estimated price along with confidence levels.
